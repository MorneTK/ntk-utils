# NTK-Utils

## Dependencies

This application uses redis on the default port.  If you wish to run it locally, you'll need to set redis up for your OS and run a local redis server first.

For Linux-based systems, download and setup instructions can be found at the official redis site here: https://redis.io/
For Windows, go here: https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases 

## Development server

Run `ng build` to build the angular project, and then `node server` to run the application.
Access the running server via any web browser:  `localhost:3000`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
